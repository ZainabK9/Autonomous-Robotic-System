# Autonomous-Robotic-System
Autonomous robotic system simulating exploration, localization, mapping, and navigation using differential drive, Kalman Filter, EKF-SLAM, and a neural controller evolved via Natural Evolution Strategies (NES). Developed in Python (Pygame, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib) for the Autonomous Robotic Systems course.

This project implements a full **autonomous robot pipeline** ‚Äî from simulation and localization to mapping and learned navigation ‚Äî for a **differential-drive robot** in a 2D environment with obstacles.  
It was developed for the **Autonomous Robotic Systems (ARS)** course at **Maastricht University**.

## Project Overview

The robot autonomously explores an unknown environment, avoids obstacles, constructs an occupancy grid map, and finds a target (‚Äúrescue mission‚Äù) without human input.

The project was completed in **four milestones**:
1. **Simulation:** Differential-drive robot simulation with obstacle avoidance  
2. **Localization:** Pose estimation using a **Linear Kalman Filter**  
3. **Mapping:** Occupancy grid + **EKF-SLAM** for simultaneous localization and mapping  
4. **Navigation:** Learned neural controller trained via **Natural Evolution Strategies (NES)** for autonomous exploration

## Technical Details

### Simulation
- Robot represented as a circle with **12 distance sensors** (30¬∞ spacing)  
- **Spawn validation** prevents initialization on obstacles  
- Manual testing with motor control (W + arrow keys)

### Localization (Kalman Filter)
- Combines **velocity-based motion model** and **trilateration landmarks**
- Corrects robot pose when ‚â•3 landmarks are visible
- Experiments on **sensor and motion noise (Q, R matrices)**

### Mapping (EKF-SLAM)
- Occupancy grid for static obstacle mapping  
- EKF-SLAM integrates localization & mapping  
- Occlusion handling and noise-sensitive occupancy probabilities

### Navigation (Neural Controller + NES)
- **Input:** 117 features (pose, sensors, coverage grid, hidden state)  
- **Output:** ŒîŒ∏ (turning angle)  
- Optimized using **Natural Evolution Strategies**  
- Fitness: maximize explored area, minimize collisions
